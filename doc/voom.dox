  The <b>V</b>ariational <b>O</b>bject-<b>O</b>riented
  <b>M</b>echanics (VOOM) library, is a collection of C++ classes
  designed for development of numerical simulations of continuum solid
  and structural mechanics problems, using the Finite Element Method.
  The simulation framework is organized according to the use of
  variational principles in the formulation of mechanics problems,
  including virtual work and minimum potential energy for elasticity,
  and variational constitutive updates for inelasticity.  

  Many VOOM classes make use of code from two third-party open-source
  projects designed for fast and efficient scientific computation, <a
  href=http://oonumerics.org/blitz/><tt>blitz++</tt></a>, and <a
  href=http://tvmet.sourceforge.net/><tt>tvmet</tt></a>.  The
  <tt>Vector</tt> and <tt>Matrix</tt> classes from <tt>tvmet</tt> are
  used for small fixed-size (known at compile time) one- and
  two-dimensional arrays.  The <tt>blitz++ Array</tt> class is used
  for dynamic arrays (sized at run time) and higher dimensional arrays
  (3-D or higher).  Thorough documentation on <tt>blitz++</tt> and
  <tt>tvmet</tt> can be found at their respective web sites.

  VOOM is developed for research and teaching uses under the direction
  of Professor W.S. Klug in the <a
  href=http://www.mae.ucla.edu>Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
  department</a> at <a href=http://www.ucla.edu>UCLA</a>.
