This directory contains the source for two executables, indent and
relax, each of which links to ../libvoom.a.  The Automake scripts are
setup to build the executables using GCC.  If you want to use the
Intel compilers, some modifications are necessary as provided in the
file Makefile.am.icpc.  Summary descroptions of both programs are below.



NAME
	indent - indent a triangulated shell

SYNOPSIS
	indent modelName [options]

DESCRIPTION
	This program inputs a triangulated mesh of a close shell
	(i.e., no boundary) and indents the shell between a rigid flat
	surface and a rigid indenter (which may be spherical or flat).

	The vertex positions and connectivities of the mesh are input
	from the file modelName.vtk which is in legacy VTK format (see
	www.vtk.org).

	The vertex positions are scaled so that the average radius of
	the shell is one.  The 2-D Young's modulus and bending modulus
	are computed from an input FvK ratio as follows

	Y = 1/\kappa = \sqrt{\gamma}

	This is done such that the definition \gamma = YR^2/\kappa is
	obtained along with a force-normalization condition
	\sqrt{Y\kappa}=1.

	An initial and minimum increment size are specified for the
	indentation process, but the increment size is adaptively
	modified for efficiency.

	The sequence of deformed shapes is output to VTK files, and
	force-indentation data is output to the ascii text file
	modelName.fz.

	The following options can be added as arguments at invocation

	-b yes|no
		The boundary condition flag specifies whether the
		apices of the mesh should be constrained against
		lateral movement to prevent rotation of the shell.

	-g gamma 
		The input FvK number.  

	-i max_indentation
		The final indentation value at which the calculation
		should stop.

	-m min_step
		The minimum indentation increment/step size.

	-p yes|no
		The prestress flag: if "no" then the reference
		configuration of shell is set to be spherical with a
		spontaneous curvature equal to the inverse radius.

	-r 
		Model the indenter as a rigid (hemi)sphere.  By
		default the indenter is modeled as a flat plate.

	-s step
		The initial indentation increment/step size.

	-v viscosity
		Artificial viscosity parameter used to stabilize the
		minimization algorithm when tracking a force drop in
		the indentation curve.



NAME
	relax - relax an input mesh to compute aspherity

SYNOPSIS
	relax modelName

DESCRIPTION
	This program inputs a triangulated mesh of a close shell
	(i.e., no boundary), minimizes the combination of bending and
	stretching area to compute aspherity over a range of FvK numbers.

	The vertex positions and connectivities of the mesh are input
	from the file modelName.vtk which is in legacy VTK format (see
	www.vtk.org).

	The vertex positions are scaled so that the average radius of
	the shell is one.  The 2-D Young's modulus and bending modulus
	are computed from an input FvK ratio as follows

	Y = 1/\kappa = \sqrt{\gamma}

	This is done such that the definition \gamma = YR^2/\kappa is
	obtained along with a force-normalization condition
	\sqrt{Y\kappa}=1.
	
	The relaxed shapes are output to VTK files, and the aspherity
	vs. FvK data is output to the file modelName.aspherity.dat.
