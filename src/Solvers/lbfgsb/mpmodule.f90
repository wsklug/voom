!  PURPOSE OF PACKAGE:
!    This package permits one to perform floating-point computations (real and
!    complex) to arbitrarily high numeric precision, by making only relatively
!    minor changes to existing Fortran-90 programs.  All basic arithmetic
!    operations and transcendental functions are supported, together with several
!    special functions.

!    This version differs from the MPFUN-Fort version by the same author in that
!    it is based on MPFR, which presently is the fastest available low-level
!    package for high-precision floating-point computation.  Thus most user
!    applications typically run 3X faster.  In addition, the developers of the
!    MPFR package have taken considerable pains to ensure that the many functions
!    return correctly rounded (to the last bit) results for each input.  At the
!    Fortran user level, application codes written for MPFUN-Fort may be compiled
!    and executed with MPFUN-MPFR --i.e., MPFUN-MPFR is "plug compatible" with
!    MPFUN-Fort.

!  DOCUMENTATION:
!    A detailed description of this package, and instructions for compiling
!    and testing this program on various specific systems are included in the
!    README file accompanying this package, and, in more detail, in the
!    following technical paper:
